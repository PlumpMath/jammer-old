;; they will send us a message telling us it's time to jam, when that
;; happens we will need to tell the audio system to load everything,
;; once it's ready to go it'll tell us and we'll set the state of the
;; program to jamming with will send a change-state method which will
;; render the view. Should probably also have a state called loading
;; so that the user sees something and doesn't just think the button
;; is broken.
